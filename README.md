# WebRTC Practise Repo

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is peer-to-peer protocol that enables real time communication in browser without needing any additional plugins. It contains several API to make video streaming, audio streaming, screen sharing, file sharing, data sharing and much more possible.

checkout my blog post on [webrtc](https://mystica.me/blog/webrtc/) for understanding webrtc :)

This repo is to play around and experiment with webrtc technology!

[broadcast-channel](https://github.com/mystica2000/webrtc-experiments/tree/main/src/broadcast-channel) - uses broadcast channel as signalling server for a simple setup to understand webrtc
[webrtc-mono-repo](https://github.com/mystica2000/webrtc-experiments/tree/main/src/webrtc-mono-repo) - contains socket io as signalling server (includes: video call, mouse pointer position)
